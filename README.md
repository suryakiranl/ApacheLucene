ApacheLuceneTry
===============

Sample project trying Apache Lucene to search text files in a specified path

How to Run?
===========
- Clone the project
- Import it as a Java project into Eclipse (I used Eclipse Version: Kepler Service Release 1; Build id: 20130919-0819)
- Open the file SearchFileContents.java and edit the folderToSearch (in line 58) and the parameter to parseAndPrintOccurances (in line 63).
- Run the program to see results :)
